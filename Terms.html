    <h1>Zyphria Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: November 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using the Zyphria Discord Bot Framework (“Zyphria”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, you may not use Zyphria or any of its features.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use Zyphria. By using the bot, you represent that you meet these eligibility requirements.</p>

    <h2>3. Bot Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You may use Zyphria for personal or community purposes within Discord servers.</li>
        <li>You may not use Zyphria for illegal activities, harassment, spamming, or any activity that violates Discord’s Terms of Service.</li>
        <li>You may not reverse engineer, copy, modify, or redistribute Zyphria without permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Account Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for all actions performed by your Discord account in conjunction with Zyphria. Keep your bot token and any API keys secure. Zyphria is not responsible for actions taken by your account.</p>

    <h2>5. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Zyphria may store minimal data to operate its features (e.g., economy balances, warnings). Sensitive information such as Discord tokens, passwords, or private messages are never stored. For more details, see our <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Warnings and Moderation</h2>
    <p>Server administrators are responsible for moderation using Zyphria. Zyphria may provide tools like warnings, timeouts, bans, and logs. The framework itself is not responsible for enforcing rules; it is a tool for server management.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Zyphria is provided “as is” and without warranties of any kind. The developers are not liable for damages, losses, or disruptions arising from the use of Zyphria. Use it at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>8. Updates and Modifications</h2>
    <p>We may update Zyphria or its Terms at any time. Continued use of Zyphria constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may disable your access to Zyphria if you violate these Terms or Discord’s policies. You may also stop using Zyphria at any time.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your jurisdiction where Zyphria is operated. Any disputes shall be resolved under applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about these Terms, please contact the developer at <a href="mailto:Zyphria@proton.me">Zyphria@proton.me</a>.</p>

    <p>By using Zyphria, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these Terms of Service.</p>
